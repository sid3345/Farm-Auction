A web application to let farmer auction their crop online.

YouTube video explaination: https://youtu.be/3hS-1d5DZK8

(Filenames are vehicles as it was developed previously for vehicles. Bikes -> Fruits, Cars -> Vegetables).

## Stakeholders: 
Buyer, Administrator and Seller (farmer) .

## User: 
User needs to register and create an account to bid for various crops listed on the website. Each crop has an allotted
time, after which the crop list expires, and the highest bid wins. Live top bid information can be seen. The buyer also
needs to deposit certain amount before he can start bidding.
## Administrator:
Admin can add, modify and delete the crops listed on the website. He / She can also block a particular user.
Various crop information such as crop type, soil type, region, state, harvest date, bidding duration, crop images etc,
should be added. He also accepts payment from the buyer and thus allows him to bid.
## Seller (farmer):
Seller also has to register and create an account. He can also add crop, and track the live bids on his crop.

We developed this project for Smart India Hackathon, 2020, in ‘agriculture’ domain.

Domain: Web Development

Programming language: PHP

Scripting language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL.

Still in process! Bugs present.



Currently developing farmer dashboard, so that farmer can add produce, rather than administrator, and let the administrator rectify, accept or reject the produce added. Also, thinking of some ML integration.

Any ideas / suggestions welcome!!
